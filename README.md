# Oz-text-analysis
This project is a text analysis of The Wizard of Oz and The Marvelous Land of Oz by Frank L. Baum. It uses the tidytext framework in R developed by Julia Silge and David Robinson for data cleaning, tokenization, word count and sentiment analysis. It includes the use of Bootstrap to create a responsive web page of the results.
The analysis includes word frequencies and a sentiment analysis which plots the sentiment vs the plot of the text at different increments. To view the reults, go to https://mateoias.github.io/Oz-text-analysis/index.html
